data is separated by '\u241f' because its unlikely that an irc message
will have that character in it. this means that everything sent through
the pipe has to escape this character (protip: `str.replace('\u241f', '_')`)

all arguments are imploded by '\u241f' to send them through the pipe and
all lines are separated by '\r\n'. irc already prohibits having newlines in
a message, so avoid sending newlines on messages.
